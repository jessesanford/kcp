|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| feature-tmc-completion-p6w1-cluster-controller | 650 | ✅ UPDATED | Depends on SyncTarget |
| feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-core | 700 | ✅ UPDATED | Critical path for Wave 3 |
| feature-tmc-completion-p6w3-quota-manager | 550 | ✅ UPDATED | Depends on SyncTarget |

### Wave 3 (After Wave 2 VW Core)
| Worktree | Lines | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-endpoints | 600 | ✅ UPDATED | Extends VW core |
| feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-discovery | 500 | ✅ UPDATED | Extends VW core |
| feature-tmc-completion-p6w3-aggregator | 500 | ✅ UPDATED | Integrates with quota |

## Phase Reference Updates

### Branch Naming Updates
- All branches renamed from `p1w*` to `p6w*` pattern
- Old `p1w*` branches deleted from remote
- All worktrees recreated with correct naming

### Phase Reference Corrections
- All "Phase 0" references updated to "Phase 5"
- All "Phase 1" references updated to "Phase 6"
- Dependencies correctly reference Phase 5 APIs and interfaces

## File Status Report

### Newly Created
1. **feature-tmc-completion-p6w1-synctarget-controller/implementation-instructions.md**
   - Created comprehensive instructions for the critical path SyncTarget controller
   - Includes detailed step-by-step implementation guide
   - Contains KCP patterns, testing requirements, and integration points
   - Properly documented wave dependencies and blocks with Phase 6 references

### Updated Files (Phase References Corrected)
1. feature-tmc-completion-p6w3-webhooks/implementation-instructions.md
2. feature-tmc-completion-p6w1-cluster-controller/implementation-instructions.md
3. feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-core/implementation-instructions.md
4. feature-tmc-completion-p6w3-quota-manager/implementation-instructions.md
5. feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-endpoints/implementation-instructions.md
6. feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-discovery/implementation-instructions.md
7. feature-tmc-completion-p6w3-aggregator/implementation-instructions.md

## Key Features of Implementation Instructions

Each file contains:
- ✅ **Overview** with branch name and purpose
- ✅ **Line estimates** matching the wave plan (4,800 total lines)
- ✅ **Wave assignment** and parallelization info
- ✅ **Dependencies** clearly stated (both requires and blocks)
- ✅ **Detailed file list** with line estimates per file
- ✅ **Step-by-step implementation guide**
- ✅ **KCP patterns** to follow
- ✅ **Testing requirements** (unit and integration)
- ✅ **Integration points** with other components
- ✅ **Validation checklist** for PR readiness

## Agent Work Assignment

### Wave 1 (Day 1)
- **Agent 1**: feature-tmc-completion-p6w1-synctarget-controller (Critical Path)
- **Agent 2**: feature-tmc-completion-p6w3-webhooks (Independent)

### Wave 2 (Day 2-3 AM)
- **Agent 1**: feature-tmc-completion-p6w1-cluster-controller
- **Agent 2**: feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-core (Critical Path)
- **Agent 3**: feature-tmc-completion-p6w3-quota-manager

### Wave 3 (Day 3 PM-4)
- **Agent 1**: feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-endpoints
- **Agent 2**: feature-tmc-completion-p6w2-vw-discovery
- **Agent 3**: feature-tmc-completion-p6w3-aggregator

## Next Steps

1. **Agents can begin Wave 1 implementation** immediately after Phase 5 completion
2. Each agent should:
   - Navigate to their assigned worktree
   - Read the implementation-instructions.md file
   - Follow the step-by-step guide
   - Maintain the line count limits
   - Coordinate on shared interfaces

3. **Critical path priorities**:
   - Wave 1: p6w1-synctarget-controller must complete first
   - Wave 2: p6w2-vw-core is critical for Wave 3
   - All other branches can proceed in parallel within their waves

## Validation

All implementation instruction files are:
- Self-contained for autonomous agent work
- Follow the wave dependencies from the plan
- Include comprehensive implementation details
- Ready for parallel execution

Total implementation: 4,800 lines across 8 branches
Estimated completion: 3-4 days with 3 parallel agents
