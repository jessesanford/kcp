# Wave Implementation Plan: Syncer Workload Synchronization

## Executive Summary
This wave implementation plan optimizes the parallel development of 12 syncer workload branches through strategic wave orchestration. The plan enables 4-5 parallel development teams to work simultaneously, reducing implementation time from 24 days (sequential) to 8 days (parallel waves), achieving 67% time savings.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Branches (Need Fixes)
- **sync-01-interfaces**: Foundation interfaces implemented, needs review fixes
- **sync-02a-tunnel-core**: Tunnel core split from original branch 2, needs fixes  
- **sync-02b-tunnel-auth-conn**: Tunnel auth split from original branch 2, needs fixes
- **sync-03-status-interfaces**: Status interfaces implemented, needs review fixes

### Pending Implementation
- **sync-04 through sync-12**: Not yet implemented

## Wave Decomposition Strategy

### Wave 0: Foundation Fixes (Day 0-1)
**Purpose**: Fix critical issues in foundation branches before proceeding
**Parallel Agents**: 2
**Branches**:
- Agent 1: Fix sync-01-interfaces
- Agent 2: Fix sync-02a-tunnel-core, sync-02b-tunnel-auth-conn, sync-03-status-interfaces

**Integration Points**: None - independent fixes
**Resource Conflicts**: None
**Completion Criteria**: All tests pass, linting clean, review issues addressed

### Wave 1: Core Implementation Foundation (Day 1-3)
**Purpose**: Build core sync and transformation infrastructure
**Parallel Agents**: 3

- Agent 3: sync-06-conflict-resolution (depends on sync-01)

**Integration Points**:
- sync-05 requires sync-04 completion for pipeline integration
- All require sync-01 interfaces

**Resource Conflicts**:
- `pkg/syncer/interfaces/` - read-only after Wave 0
- `pkg/syncer/transform/` - owned by Agent 1
- `pkg/syncer/engine/` - owned by Agent 2

- sync-11 requires sync-05 engine and sync-06 conflict resolution

**Resource Conflicts**:
- `pkg/status/aggregator/` - owned by Agent 7
- `pkg/syncer/handlers/` - owned by Agent 8

- Implement mock interfaces for testing
- Daily sync meetings for blockers

### Integration Risks
**Risk**: Component integration failures in Wave 4
**Mitigation**:
- Integration testing at each wave boundary
- Contract testing between components
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

### Resource Conflicts
**Risk**: Agents blocking each other on shared files
**Mitigation**:
- Clear ownership boundaries per wave
- Interface freeze after Wave 0
- Worktree isolation for parallel work

### Size Overrun Risks
**Risk**: Branches exceeding 700-line limit
**Mitigation**:
- Daily line count monitoring
- Pre-emptive branch splitting plans
- Architectural reviews before implementation
