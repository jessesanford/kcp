# Health Monitoring System Implementation - Split Plan

## Summary
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive health monitoring system for TMC components, but the implementation is 2775 lines (vs 800 line limit), requiring it to be split into smaller PRs.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Health System (~600 lines)
- HealthChecker interface for component health checking
- HealthStatus and SystemHealthStatus types with JSON serialization
- BaseHealthChecker and PeriodicHealthChecker implementations
- DefaultHealthAggregator and WeightedHealthAggregator for system-wide health
- Configurable health thresholds and timeout management

### Component Monitors (~900 lines)
- **SyncerHealthMonitor**: Monitors queue depth, sync latency, error rate, connection status
- **ControllerHealthMonitor**: Monitors work queue, reconcile rate, leader election status  
- **PlacementHealthMonitor**: Monitors scheduler availability, placement latency, cluster health ratios
- **ConnectionHealthMonitor**: Monitors heartbeat, latency, throughput, reconnection rates

### Kubernetes Probes & Reporters (~800 lines)
- **LivenessProbe**: /healthz endpoint for pod restart decisions with critical component tracking
- **ReadinessProbe**: /readyz endpoint with startup grace period for traffic routing
- **HealthStatusReporter**: Text-based detailed health reporting with verbose mode
- **JSONHealthReporter**: JSON format with component details
- **PrometheusHealthReporter**: Prometheus-compatible metrics output
- **CompactJSONHealthReporter**: Minimal JSON for lightweight checks

### Testing (~400 lines)
- Comprehensive unit tests for core interfaces and aggregation logic
- Mock implementations for all component metrics interfaces
- Integration tests for probe endpoints and reporters

## Recommended Split Strategy

### PR 1: Core Health System (feature/phase9-advanced/p9w1a-health-core) 
**~700 lines**
- Core interfaces (health.go)
- Base implementations (checker.go)  
- Aggregation logic (aggregator.go)
- Basic tests
- Foundation for other components

### PR 2: Component Monitors (feature/phase9-advanced/p9w1b-health-monitors)
**~800 lines**  
- All monitor implementations (monitors/*.go)
- Mock metrics implementations for testing
- Component-specific health logic
- Depends on PR 1

### PR 3: Probes & Reporters (feature/phase9-advanced/p9w1c-health-probes)
**~700 lines**
- Kubernetes probes (probes/*.go)
- Status reporters (reporters/*.go)
- HTTP handlers and routing
- Depends on PR 1

## Integration Points
- Will integrate with Phase 7 syncer components for metrics
- Will work with Phase 6 controllers for health monitoring
- Used by Wave 2 TUI for health display
- Provides foundation for Wave 2 CLI health commands

## Next Steps
1. Create separate branches for each split
2. Move appropriate files to each branch
3. Ensure each branch builds and tests pass independently  
4. Submit PRs in dependency order (core → monitors → probes)

## Technical Notes
- All components use context for timeout control
- Implements graceful degradation patterns
- Follows Kubernetes health check conventions
- Supports both individual component and system-wide health aggregation
- Includes comprehensive error handling and retry logic

This implementation provides a robust foundation for monitoring TMC component health across the entire system.
