## Overview
- **Original Branch**: `feature/tmc2-impl2/01j-status-management`
- **Original Size**: 921 lines
- **Target Size**: 700 lines per sub-branch
- **Split Strategy**: 2 sub-branches focusing on status management aspects

## Split Plan

### Sub-branch 1: 01j1-status-aggregation (Pending)
- **Branch**: `feature/tmc2-impl2/01j1-status-aggregation`
- **Estimated Size**: ~460 lines
- **Content**: Status aggregation and reporting
  - StatusAggregator API with multi-cluster status collection

## Implementation Order
1. ⏳ 01j1-status-aggregation (Status aggregation)
2. ⏳ 01j2-status-policies (Status-based policies)

## Dependencies
- 01j2 depends on 01j1 for aggregated status information
- Both sub-branches share status types and validation mechanisms
- Integration with health monitoring and placement systems

## Notes
