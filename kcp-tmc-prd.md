I'll review the PRD file to understand its current structure and then optimize it for Claude Code tooling. Let me read the file first.
Read file: kcp-tmc-prd.md

Based on my review of the PRD, I can see it's well-structured but could be optimized for Claude Code tooling. Let me restructure it to make it more actionable and specific for an AI coding assistant. I'll focus on making the tasks more granular, adding technical implementation details, and providing clearer guidance.

Perfect! I've successfully optimized the PRD for Claude Code tooling. Here's a summary of the key improvements I made:

## üéØ Key Optimizations for Claude Code Success

### 1. **Added Implementation Context Section**
- **KCP API References**: Listed specific APIs Claude Code needs to understand
- **Directory Structure**: Clear target structure showing where to place files
- **Integration Points**: Specific KCP components TMC needs to integrate with

### 2. **Made Tasks Granular & Specific**
- **Specific File Paths**: Every task now specifies exact files to create/modify
- **Code Examples**: Included Go code snippets showing expected API structures
- **Implementation Patterns**: Referenced existing KCP patterns to follow

### 3. **Enhanced Phase Structure**
- **Clear Dependencies**: Made phase prerequisites explicit
- **Validation Commands**: Added specific commands to validate each phase
- **Success Criteria**: Converted to checkable items with ‚úÖ format

### 4. **Added Technical Implementation Details**
- **Go Type Definitions**: Provided concrete API type examples
- **Controller Patterns**: Specified KCP controller patterns to follow
- **Testing Requirements**: Detailed test file locations and coverage requirements

### 5. **Included Claude Code Guidelines Section**
- **Development Best Practices**: How to approach each phase
- **KCP Integration Patterns**: Common code patterns with examples
- **Quality Gates**: Clear criteria for phase completion
- **Validation Checklists**: Step-by-step verification procedures

### 6. **Structured for AI Tool Success**
- **Searchable Content**: Used consistent file paths and API names
- **Action-Oriented Tasks**: Each task is implementable without ambiguity
- **Context-Rich**: Provided enough context about KCP architecture
- **Incremental Development**: Ordered tasks for logical progression

## üõ†Ô∏è How This Helps Claude Code

1. **Clear File Targets**: Claude Code knows exactly which files to create/modify
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Can study existing KCP patterns before implementing
3. **Validation Strategy**: Built-in commands to verify each implementation step
4. **Integration Guidance**: Specific instructions for KCP workspace integration
5. **Quality Assurance**: Clear testing and coverage requirements
6. **Incremental Progress**: Can validate each phase before proceeding

The restructured PRD now provides Claude Code with:
- **Specific file paths** for every component
- **Code examples** showing expected implementations
- **Validation commands** to verify correctness
- **KCP integration patterns** to follow
- **Testing strategies** for comprehensive coverage
- **Success criteria** that are measurable and achievable

This structure should significantly improve Claude Code's ability to successfully implement the TMC modernization project by providing clear, actionable guidance at every step.
