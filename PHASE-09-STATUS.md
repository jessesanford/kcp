# Phase 9 Implementation Status

## Overall Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE

### Wave Implementation Status

#### Wave 1: Observability Foundation - NOT STARTED (0/2)
- [ ] `feature/phase9-advanced/p9w1-metrics` - Metrics & Telemetry (worktree ready)
- [ ] `feature/phase9-advanced/p9w1-health` - Health Monitoring (worktree ready)

**Status**: Worktrees created, branches pushed, ready for implementation

#### Wave 2: User Experience - NOT STARTED (0/3)  
- [ ] `feature/phase9-advanced/p9w2-cli` - kubectl-tmc CLI plugin (worktree ready)
- [ ] `feature/phase9-advanced/p9w2-tui` - TUI Dashboard (worktree ready)
- [ ] `feature/phase9-advanced/p9w2-docs` - API Documentation (worktree ready)

**Status**: Worktrees created, branches pushed, ready for implementation

#### Wave 3: Advanced Deployment - NEEDS RE-IMPLEMENTATION (0/2)
- [ ] `feature/phase9-advanced/p9w3-canary` - Canary Controller (TO BE CREATED)
- [ ] `feature/phase9-advanced/p9w3-rollback` - Rollback Engine (TO BE CREATED)

**Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES COMPLETE RE-IMPLEMENTATION**

### Defunct Branches (DO NOT USE)

The following branches were implemented prematurely without proper Wave 1 metrics dependency and have been marked as defunct:

- `feature/defunct-phase9-advanced/p9w3-canary-strategy` - Implemented without real metrics
- `feature/defunct-phase9-advanced/p9w3-canary-metrics` - Implemented without metrics infrastructure  
- `feature/defunct-phase9-advanced/p9w3-rollback-engine` - Depends on canary with proper metrics

**Defunct Worktrees Location**: `/workspaces/kcp-worktrees/phase9/advanced-features/worktrees/defunct-*`

### Critical Dependencies

#### Wave 3 Dependencies on Wave 1:
- Canary controller requires Wave 1 metrics for:
  - Metrics-based analysis
  - Threshold evaluation
  - Automatic promotion/rollback decisions
- Cannot be properly implemented without real metrics infrastructure

### Implementation Order

1. **First**: Complete Wave 1 (Metrics & Health)
2. **Second**: Complete Wave 2 (CLI, TUI, Docs) - can run in parallel with Wave 1
3. **Third**: Re-implement Wave 3 (Canary, Rollback) - MUST wait for Wave 1

### Notes

- Wave 3 was originally implemented as part of Phase 4 under `tmc-phase4-2X` naming
- Migrated to Phase 9 naming but implementation predated Wave 1 metrics
- Current Wave 3 implementation likely uses mock/stub metrics
- Must be completely re-implemented with proper metrics integration after Wave 1
