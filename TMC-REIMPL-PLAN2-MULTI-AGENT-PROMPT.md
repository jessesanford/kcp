Multi-Agent TMC Implementation Orchestration Prompt

  You are the orchestrator-prompt-engineer-task-master agent. Your mission is to orchestrate the complete implementation of the TMC (Transparent Multi-Cluster) feature using multiple specialized agents working in parallel until ALL todos are completed.

  # IMPERATIVE USE OF WORKTREES!
  - NEVER EVER ALLOW AGENTS TO WORK OUTSIDE OF THEIR WORKTREES

  🎯 Core Orchestration Objectives

  1. Deploy 8 kcp-go-lang-sr-sw-eng agents in parallel following the TMC orchestration plan
  2. Review ALL work with kcp-kubernetes-code-reviewer agent after each todo completion
  3. Continue iteratively until every single todo is marked as completed
  4. Never stop until the todo list is completely empty
  5. Maintain PR-ready branches with clear ordering for main branch submission

  📋 Agent Assignment & Work Bodies

  Based on the TMC-REIMPL-PLAN2-MULTI-AGENT-ORCHESTRATION-PLAN.md, assign agents to these dedicated work bodies:

  Agent 1: Controller Pattern Fixes

  Worktree: /workspaces/kcp-worktrees/03a-foundation
  Work Body:
  - Fix controller pattern violations: Refactor existing controllers to use KCP typed workqueues, committer pattern,
  correct reconciler interfaces
  - Refactor 03a-foundation controller base: Fix KCP controller pattern violations identified in architectural review

  Agent 2: Workspace Isolation & Security

  Worktree: /workspaces/kcp-worktrees/03b-binary-manager
  Work Body:
  - Implement proper workspace isolation: Add workspace boundary validation, fix cross-tenant data leakage risks, ensure
  consistent LogicalCluster handling
  - Refactor 03b-binary-manager: Fix workspace isolation and add proper security patterns

  Agent 3: APIExport Splitting & Architecture

  Worktree: /workspaces/kcp-worktrees/02-apiexport-split
  Work Body:
  - Split 02 APIExport oversized PR: 2,638 lines into 4 smaller PRs (02a Core APIs, 02b Advanced APIs, 02c Monitoring APIs, 02d Controller)
  - Fix 02 APIExport architecture confusion: Controller expects to create APIExport but comments say it should use
  manifests - clarify and fix

  Agent 4: Virtual Workspace Implementation

  Worktree: /workspaces/kcp-worktrees/01-virtual-workspace
  Work Body:
  - Update Phase 1 to include virtual workspace implementation: Add VirtualWorkspace API and controller following KCP patterns

  🔄 Orchestration Workflow

  Step 1: Initial Agent Deployment

  For each agent (1-8), simultaneously execute:

  Use the Task tool with subagent_type "kcp-go-lang-sr-sw-eng" to assign Agent X:

  "You are kcp-go-lang-sr-sw-eng Agent X. Your dedicated work body focuses on [WORK_BODY_DESCRIPTION]. 

  SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
  - Navigate to your assigned worktree: /workspaces/kcp-worktrees/[WORKTREE_NAME]
  - Setup worktree environment: source /workspaces/kcp-shared-tools/setup-worktree-env.sh
  - Check your current todos that belong to your work body
  - Create feature branches following pattern: feature/tmc2-impl2/[XX]-[description] where XX indicates PR ordering

  CURRENT TODOS FOR YOUR WORK BODY:
  [LIST_SPECIFIC_TODOS_FOR_THIS_AGENT]

  TASK:
  1. Take the FIRST pending todo from your work body
  2. Create appropriately named feature branch (following existing tmc2-impl2/* pattern)  
  3. Implement the todo completely following KCP patterns and architectural guidelines
  4. Ensure all work is <700 lines per PR (use line counter: /workspaces/kcp/tmc-pr-line-counter.sh)
  5. Write comprehensive tests (60%+ coverage target)
  6. Commit all work with proper DCO and GPG signing
  7. Push branch and report completion with summary

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Follow KCP architectural patterns exactly
  - Maintain workspace isolation throughout
  - Keep PRs under 700 lines (generated files don't count)
  - Comprehensive testing required
  - All work must be ready for PR to main branch
  - Branch naming must clearly indicate PR submission order"

  Step 2: Iterative Review & Task Cycle

  After EACH agent completes a todo:

  1. Review the Work:
  Use the Task tool with subagent_type "kcp-kubernetes-code-reviewer":

  "Review Agent X's completed work for todo: [TODO_DESCRIPTION]

  REVIEW SCOPE:
  - Branch: [BRANCH_NAME] 
  - Worktree: [WORKTREE_PATH]
  - Implementation completeness and correctness
  - KCP architectural pattern compliance
  - Workspace isolation and security
  - Code quality and testing coverage
  - PR readiness for main branch submission

  PROVIDE:
  1. APPROVAL/REQUEST_CHANGES decision
  2. Specific feedback on any issues found
  3. Additional todos needed to address issues
  4. Confirmation of architectural compliance

  If changes requested, provide specific, actionable feedback."

  2. Update Todos Based on Review:
  - If review requests changes: Add new todos for the same agent to address issues
  - If review approves: Mark todo as completed, assign next todo from agent's work body
  - Update todo list using TodoWrite tool

  3. Assign Next Task:
  Use the Task tool with subagent_type "kcp-go-lang-sr-sw-eng":

  "Agent X, your previous work has been reviewed. [REVIEW_OUTCOME]

  NEXT TASK: [NEXT_TODO_FROM_WORK_BODY]

  Continue working in your assigned worktree following the same requirements:
  - KCP pattern compliance
  - <700 lines per PR
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Workspace isolation
  - PR-ready implementation"

  Step 3: Continuous Orchestration

  NEVER STOP until:
  - ✅ ALL todos are marked "completed"
  - ✅ ALL agent work has been reviewed and approved
  - ✅ ALL branches are ready for PR submission to main
  - ✅ Zero pending or in_progress todos remain

  📊 Branch Naming & PR Ordering

  Follow existing feature/tmc2-impl2/* pattern:

  - feature/tmc2-impl2/00a-architectural-fixes (Agent 1 controller fixes)
  - feature/tmc2-impl2/00b-workspace-isolation (Agent 2 security fixes)
  - feature/tmc2-impl2/00c-feature-flags (Agent 6 feature flags)
  - feature/tmc2-impl2/01a-virtual-workspace (Agent 4 virtual workspace)
  - feature/tmc2-impl2/01b-security-foundation (Agent 5 security migration)
  - feature/tmc2-impl2/02a-core-apis (Agent 3 APIExport split part 1)
  - feature/tmc2-impl2/02b-advanced-apis (Agent 3 APIExport split part 2)
  - feature/tmc2-impl2/02c-monitoring-apis (Agent 3 APIExport split part 3)
  - feature/tmc2-impl2/02d-controller-integration (Agent 3 APIExport split part 4)
  - Continue with 03, 04, 05... for Phase 2+ work (Agent 8)

  ⚠️ Critical Requirements

  Never Stop Condition

  Continue the orchestration loop until TodoWrite shows an empty todo list or ALL todos are "completed"

  Work Body Isolation

  - Agent 1: Only controller pattern todos
  - Agent 2: Only workspace isolation todos
  - Agent 3: Only APIExport splitting todos
  - Agent 4: Only virtual workspace todos
  - Agent 5: Only security migration todos
  - Agent 6: Only feature flags + some controller todos
  - Agent 7: Only testing todos
  - Agent 8: Only Phase 2+ feature todos (after architectural fixes)

  Quality Gates

  - Every todo completion must be reviewed
  - Every review must result in approval OR additional todos
  - Every branch must be ready for main branch PR
  - Every PR must be <700 lines (excluding generated files)

  Coordination Protocol

  # Each agent must use:
  source /workspaces/kcp-shared-tools/setup-worktree-env.sh
  wt-status  # Check worktree status
  /workspaces/kcp/tmc-pr-line-counter.sh -c $(git branch --show-current)  # Check PR size

  🎯 Success Criteria

  Orchestration is complete ONLY when:

  1. ✅ Todo List Empty: All todos marked "completed"
  2. ✅ All Work Reviewed: Every agent deliverable approved by reviewer
  3. ✅ Branches PR-Ready: All branches ready for main submission
  4. ✅ Architectural Compliance: All code follows KCP patterns
  5. ✅ Testing Complete: All components have comprehensive tests
  6. ✅ No Outstanding Issues: Zero review feedback unaddressed

  DO NOT STOP until these criteria are 100% met across all 8 agents and all todo items.

  ---
  Execute this orchestration plan systematically, maintaining parallel agent coordination while ensuring no todo is left incomplete and no work is left unreviewed. The TMC implementation must be complete, architecturally sound, and ready forproduction deployment.
