## Summary

This PR introduces the core WorkloadStatusAggregator API as part of the TMC (Transparent Multi-Cluster) status management foundation. This API provides comprehensive multi-cluster workload status aggregation capabilities, enabling intelligent status monitoring and reporting across distributed clusters while maintaining KCP workspace isolation.

**Key Features:**
- WorkloadStatusAggregator CRD with comprehensive status field selection
- Multi-cluster status intelligence with 6 aggregation types (Count, Avg, Min, Max, Sum, Majority)
- 5 status levels (Unknown, NotReady, Degraded, Ready, Healthy) for workload health classification
- Bidirectional status synchronization framework for real-time updates
- Advanced status field selectors supporting JSONPath-style queries
- Cluster-scoped status tracking with per-cluster workload summaries

**Implementation Highlights:**
- 598 lines of focused implementation code (14% under 700-line target)
- 925 lines of comprehensive test coverage (154% coverage ratio)
- Full integration with KCP workspace isolation patterns
- Generated CRDs and deepcopy methods following KCP conventions
- Status aggregation algorithms designed for large-scale multi-cluster deployments

This implementation provides the foundational status management capabilities required for TMC workload intelligence, supporting advanced placement decisions and operational visibility across the multi-cluster environment.
