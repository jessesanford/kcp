## Summary

Implement advanced decision engine foundation for TMC workload placement with sophisticated constraint evaluation and candidate filtering. This PR provides the core infrastructure for intelligent placement decisions while keeping scoring and selection strategies for a follow-up PR.

## What Type of PR Is This?

/kind feature

## Changes Included

### Core Decision Engine (`decision.go` - 397 lines)
- **DecisionEngine struct**: Main orchestrator for placement decisions
- **Advanced constraint filtering**: Location selector matching with full MatchExpressions support
- **Affinity constraint evaluation**: Required and preferred affinity handling
- **Tolerance evaluation framework**: Placeholder for future taint/toleration support
- **Candidate management**: LocationCandidate with scoring details and constraint validation

### Scoring Infrastructure (`scoring.go` - 227 lines)
- **Multi-criteria scoring**: Affinity, capacity, spread, and latency scoring algorithms
- **Configurable weights**: ScoringWeights structure for customizable placement priorities
- **Individual score calculation**: Modular scoring components for different placement criteria
- **Weighted score combination**: Smart aggregation of multiple scoring factors
- **Human-readable scoring reasons**: Detailed explanations for placement decisions

### Selection Strategies (`selection.go` - 265 lines)
- **Four selection strategies**: Balanced, packed, spread, and score-based selection
- **Geographic distribution**: Zone and region awareness for balanced placement
- **Cluster consolidation**: Packed strategy for resource efficiency
- **Maximum spread**: Geographic diversity optimization
- **Score-based selection**: Pure performance-based placement

### Comprehensive Test Coverage (`decision_test.go` - 333 lines)
- **Strategy testing**: All four selection strategies with realistic scenarios
- **Constraint validation**: Label selector and affinity constraint testing
- **Edge cases**: Empty location sets and invalid configurations
- **Scoring validation**: Individual scoring component testing
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end placement decision workflows

## Technical Architecture

### Decision Flow
1. **Constraint Filtering**: Hard constraint evaluation (selectors, affinity)
2. **Candidate Scoring**: Multi-criteria scoring with configurable weights
3. **Strategy Selection**: Apply configured selection strategy (balanced/packed/spread/score)
4. **Decision Creation**: Convert candidates to placement decisions

### Key Design Decisions
- **Modular scoring**: Separate scoring components for maintainability
- **Strategy pattern**: Pluggable selection strategies for different use cases
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Detailed constraint failure reasons
- **KCP integration**: Proper workspace isolation and logical cluster support

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: All core functions with table-driven tests
- **Strategy testing**: Each selection strategy with realistic location sets
- **Constraint validation**: Label selector operators (In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist)
- **Edge case handling**: Empty inputs, invalid configurations, constraint failures

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient constraint evaluation**: Early filtering to reduce candidate set
- **Lazy scoring**: Only score candidates that pass constraints
- **O(n log n) selection**: Sort-based candidate ranking
- **Memory efficient**: Minimal candidate object allocation

## Integration Points

- **Workload API**: Full integration with `workloadv1alpha1.Placement` specification
- **Location API**: Advanced `workloadv1alpha1.Location` selector support
- **Constraint API**: `workloadv1alpha1.PlacementConstraints` implementation
- **KCP logging**: Structured logging with appropriate verbosity levels

## Future Enhancements (Separate PRs)

- **Resource-aware scoring**: Actual cluster capacity integration
- **Network topology**: Real latency measurements
- **Workload spread tracking**: Current placement distribution analysis
- **Custom scoring plugins**: Extensible scoring framework
