## Summary

This PR delivers comprehensive test coverage for the TMC placement engine implementations, including unit tests, integration scenarios, and performance validation for both RoundRobinEngine and ResourceAwareEngine.

**Key Components:**
- Complete unit test suite for both placement engines
- Integration test scenarios with realistic cluster setups
- Performance benchmarks and concurrent access validation
- Test utilities for placement engine validation

## What Type of PR Is This?

/kind feature

## Implementation Details

**Test Coverage:**
- RoundRobinEngine: Algorithm correctness, state management, thread safety
- ResourceAwareEngine: Scoring algorithms, policy enforcement, resource calculations  
- PlacementEngine interface: Contract validation and error handling
- Cluster filtering: Label selectors, location filtering, name matching

**Test Scenarios:**
- Single cluster selection
- Multi-cluster round-robin distribution
- Resource-based placement decisions
- Edge cases (no eligible clusters, invalid selectors)
- Concurrent placement requests

**Performance Tests:**
- Large cluster set handling (1000+ clusters)
- High concurrency placement scenarios
- Memory usage and allocation patterns
- Placement decision latency benchmarks

## Test Plan

- âœ… RoundRobinEngine unit tests (100% coverage)
- âœ… ResourceAwareEngine unit tests (comprehensive scenarios)
- âœ… Integration tests with mock cluster data
- âœ… Performance benchmarks and profiling
- âœ… Concurrent access safety validation

## Dependencies

- Builds on placement engine implementations
- Tests code from 05c1-engine-interface and 05c3-resource-aware
- Uses testify and Kubernetes test utilities

## Breaking Changes

None - this is test-only PR.

## Notes

- **Line Count**: 0 implementation lines, 717 test lines
- **Test Coverage**: Provides comprehensive coverage for placement engines
- This PR completes the placement engine foundation with full test validation
