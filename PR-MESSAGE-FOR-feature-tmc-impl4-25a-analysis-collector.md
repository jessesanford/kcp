## Summary

This PR implements the TMC placement analysis data collector component as part of splitting the larger placement analysis functionality into focused, reviewable components. The collector provides:

- **Data Collection Framework**: Core data structures for placement analysis data with timestamp tracking, cluster identification, and resource utilization metrics
- **In-Memory Data Store**: Thread-safe storage with configurable size limits and automatic data rotation
- **Prometheus Metrics Integration**: Comprehensive metrics collection including placement counts, resource utilization, health status tracking, and operation duration monitoring
- **Configurable Collection Options**: Flexible configuration for collection intervals, data retention, and metrics namespace customization

Key components:
- `PlacementData` struct with resource utilization tracking (CPU, memory, storage, pod counts)
- `DataStore` for thread-safe in-memory storage with size-based rotation
- `MetricsCollector` with Prometheus integration for monitoring and observability
- Comprehensive test coverage with table-driven tests
