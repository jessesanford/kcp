## Summary

This PR implements **cluster capability detection logic** for TMC (Transport Management Component), building on the approved cluster registration controller foundation. The capability detection system enables intelligent workload placement by discovering and reporting cluster features, API support, and resource capacity.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🔍 Cluster Capability Detection
- **API Discovery**: Probes cluster APIs to identify supported resource types and versions
- **Resource Capacity Detection**: Discovers node count and cluster resource capacity
- **Feature Detection**: Identifies supported Kubernetes features (deployments, services, ingress, storage, network policies)
- **Version Detection**: Captures Kubernetes version information for compatibility decisions

### 🏗️ Architecture & Design
- **ClusterCapabilityDetector**: Core detection engine with pluggable client factory for testability
- **APIDiscoveryClient Interface**: Abstraction layer for Kubernetes discovery API with mock support
- **Capability Refresh Logic**: Configurable intervals for keeping capability information current
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues operation even when some discovery operations fail

### 📊 Data Model Extensions
- **ClusterCapabilities Type**: New API type capturing detected cluster features
- **Integration with ClusterRegistration**: Capabilities stored in cluster status for placement decisions
- **Timestamp Tracking**: LastDetected field for cache management and refresh logic

### 🧪 Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Full coverage for all detection logic and error scenarios  
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Complete mocking for external dependencies (Kubernetes clients)
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Structured test cases covering success paths and error conditions
- **Feature Detection Tests**: Validation of cluster feature identification logic

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

├── capabilities.go       // Core detection logic (248 lines)
├── discovery.go          // API discovery implementation (177 lines)  
└── capabilities_test.go  // Comprehensive tests (407 lines)
```

### Core Components

**ClusterCapabilityDetector**:
- Manages capability detection lifecycle
- Integrates with cluster connectivity validation
- Supports configurable detection intervals (5 minutes default)
- Handles partial failures gracefully

**API Discovery System**:
- Discovers Kubernetes version and supported API groups
- Catalogs available resource types with proper namespacing
- Maps resources to TMC placement features (workloads, networking, storage)
- Handles discovery partial failures appropriately

**Capability Refresh Logic**:
- Determines when capabilities need refreshing based on staleness
- Supports immediate detection for new clusters
- Configurable refresh intervals for operational efficiency

## Integration Points

### Input Dependencies
- **Cluster Connection Information**: Uses cluster endpoint configuration from cluster registration
- **Cluster Connectivity**: Builds on connectivity validation from the base controller

### Output for Other Components  
- **Placement Decisions**: Provides capability information for Agent 1's placement engine
- **Health Monitoring**: Capability detection validates cluster accessibility
- **Feature Compatibility**: Enables workload-to-cluster feature matching

## Release Notes

```
Add cluster capability detection system for TMC workload placement. The system automatically discovers and reports Kubernetes cluster capabilities including supported APIs, resource types, node capacity, and cluster features. This enables intelligent placement decisions based on workload requirements and cluster capabilities.
