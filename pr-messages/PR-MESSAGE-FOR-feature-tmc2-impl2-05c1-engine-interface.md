## Summary

This PR introduces the foundational PlacementEngine interface and basic round-robin implementation for TMC (Transparent Multi-Cluster). This is the **first split** of an oversized placement engine PR (1,718 lines â†’ 473 lines) to meet KCP PR size requirements.

**Key Components:**
- `PlacementEngine` interface defining cluster placement algorithms
- `RoundRobinEngine` implementation with stateful round-robin cluster selection  
- Minimal TMC API stubs (`ClusterRegistration`, `WorkloadPlacement`) for interface compatibility
- Generated deepcopy methods, CRDs, and scheme registration

**Agent Integration:** This PR unblocks Agent 1's integration work by providing the essential placement interface they depend on. Full API types will be delivered in subsequent PRs.
