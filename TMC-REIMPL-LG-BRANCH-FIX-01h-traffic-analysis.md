# TMC Branch Split Plan: 01h-traffic-analysis

## Overview
- **Original Branch**: `feature/tmc2-impl2/01h-traffic-analysis`
- **Original Size**: 1,260 lines
- **Target Size**: 700 lines per sub-branch
- **Split Strategy**: 2 sub-branches focusing on different traffic analysis aspects

## Split Plan

### Sub-branch 1: 01h1-traffic-monitoring (Pending)
- **Branch**: `feature/tmc2-impl2/01h1-traffic-monitoring`
- **Estimated Size**: ~640 lines
- **Content**: Traffic monitoring and metrics collection
  - TrafficMonitor API with comprehensive traffic analysis
  - Traffic metrics collection and aggregation
  - Multi-protocol traffic analysis (HTTP, gRPC, TCP)
  - Real-time traffic pattern detection and reporting

### Sub-branch 2: 01h2-traffic-policies (Pending)
- **Branch**: `feature/tmc2-impl2/01h2-traffic-policies`
- **Estimated Size**: ~620 lines
- **Content**: Traffic-based policies and routing
  - TrafficPolicy API for traffic-based placement decisions
  - Load-based routing and traffic shaping
  - Traffic-aware scaling and capacity management
  - Policy enforcement and validation mechanisms

## Implementation Order
1. ⏳ 01h1-traffic-monitoring (Traffic monitoring foundation)
2. ⏳ 01h2-traffic-policies (Traffic-based policies)

## Dependencies
- 01h2 depends on 01h1 for traffic metrics and monitoring data
- Both sub-branches share traffic analysis types and metrics
- Integration with health monitoring and placement algorithms

## Notes
- Split maintains comprehensive traffic analysis functionality
- Monitoring and metrics collection in first sub-branch
- Policy-based traffic management in second sub-branch
- Proper separation between monitoring and policy enforcement
