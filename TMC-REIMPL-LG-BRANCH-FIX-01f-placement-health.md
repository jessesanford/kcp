  - Health status tracking and condition management
  - Core validation and test coverage

### Sub-branch 2: 01f2-health-protocols (Completed ✅)  
- **Branch**: `feature/tmc2-impl2/01f2-health-protocols`
- **Size**: ~550 lines
- **Content**: Multi-protocol health checks

## Implementation Order
1. ✅ 01f1-health-basic (Basic foundation)
2. ✅ 01f2-health-protocols (Multi-protocol support)
3. ⏳ 01f3-health-k8s (Kubernetes integration)
4. ⏳ 01f4-health-policies (Policies and recovery)

## Dependencies
- All sub-branches depend on shared types and basic health status definitions
- 01f3 and 01f4 can be developed in parallel after 01f2
- Each sub-branch is atomic and can be reviewed independently

## Notes
- Split maintains comprehensive health monitoring functionality
- Each sub-branch focuses on distinct health monitoring aspects
- Proper test coverage maintained across all sub-branches
- KCP API patterns followed throughout the split
