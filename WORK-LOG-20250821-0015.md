Branch: phase1/wave1/effort2-synctarget-types

## Effort Overview
This effort implements SyncTarget API types for TMC (Tenant Management Controller) workload management. This builds on E1.1.1 (api-types-core) and merges the SyncTarget API types from commit 2cbbc56c3.

## Specific Tasks
1. **Cherry-pick Implementation**: Get SyncTarget types from commit 2cbbc56c3
2. **API Types**: Implement SyncTarget CRD with proper spec/status structure
3. **Validation**: Add URL validation, auth type support, and connection validation  
4. **Import Updates**: Convert contrib-tmc imports to kcp/tmc structure
5. **Testing**: Create comprehensive unit tests proving requirements
6. **Code Generation**: Generate deepcopy methods and CRDs
7. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing api-types-core foundation

## Requirements Checklist
- [ ] SyncTarget CRD with connection details, credentials, capabilities in spec
- [ ] SyncTarget status with connection state, synced resources, health
- [ ] SyncTargetConnection, SyncTargetCredentials, SyncTargetCapabilities types
- [ ] URL validation functions
- [ ] Multiple auth type support (token, certificate)
- [ ] Status tracking for sync state
- [ ] Unit tests proving all validation works correctly
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage requirement
- [ ] All tests pass with -race flag
- [ ] Clean import structure using kcp/tmc paths
