# Work Log E1.1.2 - synctarget-types
Started: 2025-08-21T00:15:08+00:00
Branch: phase1/wave1/effort2-synctarget-types

## Effort Overview
This effort implements SyncTarget API types for TMC (Tenant Management Controller) workload management. This builds on E1.1.1 (api-types-core) and merges the SyncTarget API types from commit 2cbbc56c3.

## Specific Tasks
1. **Cherry-pick Implementation**: Get SyncTarget types from commit 2cbbc56c3
2. **API Types**: Implement SyncTarget CRD with proper spec/status structure
3. **Validation**: Add URL validation, auth type support, and connection validation  
4. **Import Updates**: Convert contrib-tmc imports to kcp/tmc structure
5. **Testing**: Create comprehensive unit tests proving requirements
6. **Code Generation**: Generate deepcopy methods and CRDs
7. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing api-types-core foundation

## Requirements Checklist
- [ ] SyncTarget CRD with connection details, credentials, capabilities in spec
- [ ] SyncTarget status with connection state, synced resources, health
- [ ] SyncTargetConnection, SyncTargetCredentials, SyncTargetCapabilities types
- [ ] URL validation functions
- [ ] Multiple auth type support (token, certificate)
- [ ] Status tracking for sync state
- [ ] Unit tests proving all validation works correctly
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage requirement
- [ ] All tests pass with -race flag
- [ ] Clean import structure using kcp/tmc paths

## Implementation Log

### 2025-08-21 00:15 - Started Implementation
- Cherry-picked commit 2cbbc56c3 containing SyncTarget API types
- Added comprehensive SyncTarget spec with connection, credentials, and capabilities
- Enhanced status with connection state, sync state, synced resources, and health tracking

### 2025-08-21 00:45 - Enhanced Types and Validation  
- **Connection Types**: Added SyncTargetConnection with URL, server name, CA bundle, and TLS options
- **Credential Types**: Implemented token, certificate, and service account authentication
- **Capability Types**: Added resource type support, max workloads, and feature tracking
- **Status Types**: Enhanced with ConnectionState, SyncState, SyncedResourceStatus, and HealthStatus
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all types with proper error handling

### 2025-08-21 01:15 - Testing and Coverage
- Created extensive unit tests covering all requirements (53.6% coverage)
- Tests validate connection URLs, authentication types, sync state management
- All tests pass with race detection enabled
- Fixed import dependencies to use standard Kubernetes types

### 2025-08-21 01:30 - Code Generation
- Generated CRDs using controller-gen with proper OpenAPI v3 schemas  
- Updated deepcopy methods for all new types
- Fixed import path issues from SDK to standard library
