          SessionAffinityPolicy defines session affinity and sticky placement policies for TMC workloads.
          This API provides fine-grained control over how workloads maintain affinity to specific clusters
          to ensure consistent placement and session continuity across the multi-cluster environment.

          This resource is workspace-aware and supports KCP logical cluster isolation to ensure
          proper multi-tenancy in KCP environments.
