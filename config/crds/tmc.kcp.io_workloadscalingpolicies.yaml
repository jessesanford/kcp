                            A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                            relates the key and values.

                                operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
                                Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

                                values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
                                the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                                the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                                merge patch.

                          map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                          operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
