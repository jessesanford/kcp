# PR 2: Base controller
git merge --no-ff -m "Merge PR #2: Controller foundation" origin/feature/tmc-impl4/01-base-controller
# Document any conflicts in MERGE-STRATEGY-LOG.md

# CAREFULLY resolve conflicts, document EVERYTHING

# PR 5: API resources
git merge --no-ff -m "Merge PR #5: API resources" origin/feature/tmc-impl4/04-api-resources

# VALIDATE
make generate
make build
go test ./pkg/apis/tmc/v1alpha1/...
```

### Phase 2: Critical APIs (Branches 6-14)
IMMEDIATELY after Phase 1 validation:
```bash
git merge --no-ff -m "Merge PR #6: SyncTarget API" origin/feature/phase5-api-foundation/p5w1-synctarget-api

```

### Phase 3: Core Controllers (Branches 15-24)
[Continue with all branches from the execution plan]

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION RULES

1. **API Types Conflicts** (`pkg/apis/tmc/v1alpha1/`)
   - KEEP ALL TYPES - merge additions
   - Run `make generate` after resolution
   
2. **Controller Registration** (`cmd/controller-manager/`)
   - ADD ALL controllers to startup sequence
   - Verify binary starts
   
3. **Import Conflicts**
   - Combine and deduplicate
   - Run `goimports -w .`

4. **Feature Flag Conflicts**
   - Add ALL flags, no duplicates
   - Test flag initialization

## MANDATORY VALIDATIONS

After EACH phase:
```bash
make generate
make build
go test ./...
# Update MERGE-STRATEGY-LOG.md with results
```

## CRITICAL WARNINGS

‚ùå **DO NOT**:
- Skip any branch
- Edit existing branches  
- Stop before ALL 90 branches are merged
- Leave conflicts unresolved
- Skip validation steps
- Forget to update tracking file

‚úÖ **ALWAYS**:
- Update MERGE-STRATEGY-LOG.md after EACH merge
- Document EVERY conflict resolution
- Run validation after each phase
- Continue to next phase immediately
- Push through to COMPLETION

## FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION

This merge MUST be completed. The entire TMC feature depends on it. You have ALL the tools and instructions needed. EXECUTE NOW!

Remember:
- 90 branches total
- Currently only 1 merged
- 89 to go
- NO STOPPING until complete!
