# TMC Reimplementation Plan 2 - PR Submission Plan

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the feature branches ready for PR submission against `main`, their dependencies, and the recommended submission order for the TMC Reimplementation Plan 2.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** All PRs must follow the size rules (400-700 target, 800 max) and atomic functionality principles.

## üéØ Recommended Submission Strategy

### **Sequential Submission** *(Recommended)*
Submit PRs in dependency order, waiting for each to be merged:

1. **PR 01a** (Cluster API) ‚Üí Wait for merge
2. **PR 01c** (Placement API) ‚Üí Wait for merge  
3. **PR 02** (APIExport) + **PR 04b** (Placement Engine) ‚Üí Wait for merge
4. **PR 04c** (Placement Controller) ‚Üí Wait for merge
5. **PR 04d** (Controller Manager) ‚Üí Wait for merge
6. **PR 04e** (TMC Binary) ‚Üí Wait for merge

### **Benefits of This Approach:**
- ‚úÖ **Atomic PRs**: Each PR contains one focused piece of functionality
- ‚úÖ **Size Compliant**: All PRs respect the 400-700 target, 800 max rule
- ‚úÖ **Clear Dependencies**: Linear dependency chain is easy to follow
- ‚úÖ **Easy Review**: Small, focused PRs are easier for maintainers to review
- ‚úÖ **Low Risk**: If one PR needs changes, it doesn't block others

---

## üöÄ Future API Extensions

**After the foundation is merged**, additional APIs can be added as separate PRs:

- **WorkloadHealthPolicy**: Health monitoring and recovery (in smaller chunks)
- **WorkloadSessionPolicy**: Session management and stickiness  
- **WorkloadTrafficMetrics**: Traffic analysis and insights
- **WorkloadScalingPolicy**: Auto-scaling configuration
- **WorkloadStatusAggregator**: Unified status views

Each will be implemented as focused, size-compliant PRs following the same atomic principles.

---

## ‚úÖ Quality Assurance

### **All Ready Branches Have:**
- ‚úÖ **Size Compliance**: All PRs ‚â§ 800 lines, most ‚â§ 700 lines
- ‚úÖ **Atomic Functionality**: Each PR contains one focused feature
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Tests**: Full test coverage with passing test suites
- ‚úÖ **Clean Git History**: Linear, signed commits with proper DCO
- ‚úÖ **KCP Integration**: Following established KCP patterns and conventions
- ‚úÖ **Feature Gates**: Alpha functionality properly gated and isolated
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Complete PR reviews and implementation documentation

### **Production Ready:**
All listed branches represent production-ready, atomic implementations that follow KCP best practices, maintain backward compatibility, and include comprehensive error handling and testing.
