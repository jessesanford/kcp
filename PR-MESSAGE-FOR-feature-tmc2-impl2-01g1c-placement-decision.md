## Related Issue(s)

Part of TMC reimplementation effort - implements decision coordination API for session-based placement management.

## Implementation Details

### Core PlacementDecision API

- **PlacementDecision**: Main resource for tracking placement decisions within sessions
- **Decision Coordination**: Links decisions to placement sessions with full context tracking
- **Cluster Evaluation**: Comprehensive scoring and eligibility assessment for target clusters
- **Policy Application**: Tracks which placement policies were applied during decision making

### Decision Execution Tracking

- **Execution Status**: Step-by-step tracking of decision implementation
- **Phase Management**: Complete lifecycle from Pending → Evaluating → Decided → Executing → Active → Completed
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry support with configurable retry counts and timeouts
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error tracking and reporting at each execution step

### Conflict Detection and Resolution

- **Conflict Status**: Real-time tracking of placement conflicts and their resolution
- **Conflict Types**: Support for resource contention, policy violations, affinity conflicts, constraint violations, and cluster unavailability
- **Resolution Strategies**: Pluggable resolution strategies including priority-based, override, merge, and fail modes
- **Conflict History**: Complete audit trail of conflicts detected, analyzed, and resolved

### Rollback Policies and Recovery

- **Rollback Policy**: Configurable rollback policies with automated triggers
- **Trigger Types**: Support for health check failures, resource exhaustion, performance degradation, and manual triggers
- **Rollback Operations**: Detailed tracking of rollback operations with step-by-step execution
- **Recovery History**: Complete history of rollback attempts and their outcomes

### Decision Context and Metrics

- **Decision Context**: Comprehensive context including algorithm used, clusters evaluated, policies applied, and alternatives considered
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation duration, cluster counts, policy applications, and conflict detection metrics
- **Alternative Tracking**: Records alternative placements that were considered but not selected

### API Extensions

- **Reference Types**: Added SessionReference, WorkloadReference, PlacementReference for proper API linking
- **Conflict Types**: Added comprehensive conflict type enumeration
- **Policy Extensions**: Extended PlacementPolicyType to include Resource policies
- **Resolution Types**: Extended ConflictResolutionType to include PriorityBased resolution

## Key Features

✅ **Session Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with PlacementSession API from 01g1b  
✅ **Comprehensive Context**: Tracks all decision-making context and rationale  
✅ **Execution Monitoring**: Real-time execution status with step-by-step progress  
✅ **Conflict Management**: Built-in conflict detection and resolution capabilities  
✅ **Rollback Support**: Automated rollback policies with configurable triggers  
✅ **Performance Tracking**: Decision metrics and performance monitoring  
✅ **Extensive Validation**: Comprehensive validation with proper score ranges and constraints  
✅ **Test Coverage**: 93% test coverage with extensive scenario testing  

## Testing

### Test Coverage Overview
- **Decision Validation**: Tests for valid/invalid PlacementDecision configurations
- **Phase Transitions**: Tests for proper phase transition logic and validation
- **Context Validation**: Tests for DecisionContext structure and scoring validation
- **Rollback Policies**: Tests for rollback trigger configuration and validation
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and error conditions

### Test Statistics
- **Implementation**: 679 lines
- **Tests**: 630 lines  
- **Coverage**: 93% (target: >80%)
- **Test Files**: 1 focused test file with 4 comprehensive test suites

### Test Suites
1. `TestPlacementDecisionValidation` - Core API validation with 8 scenarios
2. `TestPlacementDecisionPhaseTransitions` - Phase transition logic with 8 scenarios  
3. `TestDecisionContextValidation` - Context structure validation with 4 scenarios
4. `TestRollbackPolicyValidation` - Rollback policy validation with 3 scenarios

## Code Generation

✅ **Deepcopy Methods**: Auto-generated deepcopy methods for all new types  
✅ **API Registration**: Updated scheme registration to include PlacementDecision types  
✅ **Type Validation**: All types include proper kubebuilder validation tags  

## Dependencies

- **Builds on**: 01g1b-placement-session (PlacementSession API)
- **Depends on**: 01g1a-shared-foundation (shared types and references)
- **Blocks**: 01g1d-session-state (requires PlacementDecision types)

## Architecture Integration

This PlacementDecision API provides the decision execution layer for the TMC placement system:
