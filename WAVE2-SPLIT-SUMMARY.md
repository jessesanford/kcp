# Wave 2 Branch Split Summary

## Overview
Three Wave 2 branches exceeded the 800-line limit and require splitting into smaller, atomic PRs.

## Branch 17: CEL Evaluator (912 lines → 3 sub-branches)
**Original:** feature/tmc-phase4-17-cel-evaluator

### Split Structure:
- **17a: Core Types and Interfaces** (297 lines)
  - Interfaces, types, and caching foundation
  - No dependencies
  
- **17b: Environment and Compiler** (517 lines)
  - CEL environment setup, compiler, functions
  - Depends on 17a
  
- **17c: Evaluator and Integration** (321 lines)
  - Main evaluator logic and tests
  - Depends on 17a, 17b

## Branch 20: Canary Strategy (1305 lines → 3 sub-branches)
**Original:** feature/tmc-phase4-20-canary-strategy

### Split Structure:
- **20a: State Machine and Traffic** (338 lines)
  - Core state management and traffic splitting
  - No dependencies
  
- **20b: Metrics and Analysis** (620 lines)
  - Metrics collection and analysis engine
  - Depends on 20a
  
- **20c: Controller and Tests** (603 lines)
  - Main controller implementation with tests
  - Depends on 20a, 20b

## Branch 21: Dependency Graph (988 lines → 2 sub-branches)
**Original:** feature/tmc-phase4-21-dependency-graph

### Split Structure:
- **21a: Core Graph Implementation** (652 lines)
  - Graph structure and topological sort
  - No dependencies
  
- **21b: Validation and Tests** (768 lines)
  - Validation logic and comprehensive tests
  - Depends on 21a

## Execution Timeline

### Sequential Order:
1. Branch 17a → 17b → 17c (CEL Evaluator)
2. Branch 20a → 20b → 20c (Canary Strategy)
3. Branch 21a → 21b (Dependency Graph)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities:
- 17a, 20a, and 21a can be developed in parallel (no dependencies)
- 17b, 20b can proceed once their 'a' branches are complete
- 17c, 20c, 21b finalize their respective features

## Success Metrics
- All sub-branches under 700 lines (optimal) or 800 lines (maximum)
- Each sub-branch maintains atomic functionality
- Clear dependency chains established
- Test coverage distributed appropriately
- Documentation included with relevant code

## Next Steps
1. Create new branches following the naming convention
2. Move code according to split plans
3. Ensure each branch passes tests independently
4. Create PRs in dependency order
5. Update PR plan with new branch structure
