Based on my thorough analysis, I can see that YES - there are indeed more feature branches needed. The pre-feature-branch-reorg
  branch contains 488 files total with comprehensive TMC implementation that includes several major components we haven't captured
  yet.

  Here are the 3 additional feature branches we need to complete the full TMC implementation:

  Answer: YES - 3 More Feature Branches Required

  1. Documentation Branch (feature/tmc-documentation)

  - TMC-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md - Complete implementation summary
  - TMC-NEXT-STEPS.md - Future roadmap and next steps
  - BUILD-TMC.md - Build and deployment guide

  2. Deployment Automation Branch (feature/tmc-deployment-charts)

  - Complete Helm Charts: charts/kcp-syncer/ and charts/kcp-tmc/
  - Production deployment automation for all TMC components
  - RBAC, services, deployments, configmaps for production use

  3. Demos and Tutorials Branch (feature/tmc-demos-tutorials)

  - Cross-cluster controller demo (demos/cross-cluster-controller/)
  - Disaster recovery demo (demos/disaster-recovery/)
  - Working examples and tutorials for TMC functionality
