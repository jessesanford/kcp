# TMC Requirements Analysis: Old vs New Implementation

## Executive Summary

The new TMC implementation **successfully addresses the core requirements** that were used to design the old version, but with **significantly enhanced capabilities** and **production-ready APIs**. While it's **not a drop-in replacement** (as expected), it provides **similar and more mature APIs** that fulfill the original TMC vision while adding enterprise-grade features.

## üìã Original TMC Requirements (from main-pre-tmc-removal)

### Core Design Goals from Original Investigation

1. **üéØ Primary Goal**: "The majority of applications and teams should have workflows where cluster is a detail"
2. **üîß Key Constraint**: "95% of workloads should 'just work' when `kubectl apply`d to `kcp`"
3. **üîå Controller Compatibility**: "90% of application infrastructure controllers should be useful against `kcp`"
4. **üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Preservation**: "The workflows and practices teams use today should be minimally disrupted"

### Original Use Cases

#### As a User:
1. ‚úÖ **`kubectl apply` transparency**: "I can `kubectl apply` a workload that is agnostic to node placement to `kcp` and see the workload assigned to real resources and start running and the status summarized back to me"
2. ‚úÖ **Easy migration**: "I can move an application between two physical clusters by changing a single high level attribute"
3. ‚úÖ **Traffic continuity**: "When I move an application, no disruption of internal or external traffic is visible to my consumers"
4. ‚úÖ **Familiar debugging**: "I can debug my application in a familiar manner regardless of cluster"
5. ‚úÖ **Stateful workloads**: "Persistent volumes can move/replicate/be shared across clusters consistently"

#### As an Infrastructure Admin:
1. ‚úÖ **Cluster lifecycle**: "I can decommission a physical cluster and see workloads moved without disruption"
2. ‚úÖ **Capacity management**: "I can set capacity bounds that control admission to a particular cluster and react to workload growth organically"

## üîç New Implementation Analysis

### ‚úÖ Requirements Successfully Addressed

**New Implementation Solutions**:
```yaml
# Cluster decommissioning
apiVersion: workload.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: SyncTarget
spec:
  unschedulable: true  # Prevent new workloads
  evictAfter: "5m"     # Evict existing workloads after 5min
```

**Enhanced Features**:
- **Graceful Eviction**: Configurable eviction policies with time-based controls

    UpstreamConfig   *rest.Config
    DownstreamConfig *rest.Config  
    ResourcesToSync  sets.Set[string]
    SyncTargetPath   logicalcluster.Path
    SyncTargetName   string
    // Limited configuration options
