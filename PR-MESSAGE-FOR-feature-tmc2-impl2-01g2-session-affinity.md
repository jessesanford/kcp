## Summary

This PR implements focused session affinity and sticky binding APIs for the TMC (Transparent Multi-Cluster) system as part of the TMC 2.0 implementation plan. The APIs provide fine-grained control over session affinity and persistent session-to-cluster bindings for workload placement across the multi-cluster environment.

### Key Components

1. **SessionAffinityPolicy API** - Controls how workloads maintain affinity to specific clusters based on session characteristics like client IP, cookies, headers, or persistent sessions
2. **StickyBinding API** - Manages persistent session-to-cluster bindings with configurable expiration, auto-renewal, and conflict resolution
3. **SessionBindingConstraint API** - Enforces constraints on session binding operations with rule-based validation and exemption management

### Features Implemented

- **Multiple Affinity Types**: Support for ClientIP, Cookie, Header, WorkloadUID, and PersistentSession affinity mechanisms
- **Configurable Stickiness**: Hard, soft, and adaptive enforcement levels with configurable duration and rebalancing policies
- **Comprehensive Rule Framework**: Affinity rules with constraints, preferences, and weighted scoring for placement decisions
- **Binding Persistence**: Multiple storage backends (Memory, ConfigMap, Secret, CustomResource, External) with TTL and cleanup
- **Failover Support**: Configurable failover policies with delay, retry logic, and alternative cluster selection
- **Constraint Management**: Rich constraint system with exemptions, conditions, and violation tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in performance tracking and reporting for binding effectiveness

### API Design Highlights

- **KCP Integration**: Follows KCP API design patterns with proper conditions, status reporting, and workspace awareness
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive validation, error handling, and observability features
- **Extensible**: Modular design allows for future extensions and customizations
- **Operator Friendly**: Clear status reporting, events, and troubleshooting information

## Release Notes

```release-note
Add comprehensive session affinity and sticky binding APIs for TMC multi-cluster workload placement. Includes SessionAffinityPolicy for fine-grained affinity control, StickyBinding for persistent session-to-cluster bindings, and SessionBindingConstraint for constraint enforcement. Features multiple affinity types, configurable stickiness policies, comprehensive rule framework, and production-ready observability.

## Implementation Details

### Line Count Analysis
- **types_session_affinity.go**: 673 lines - SessionAffinityPolicy API with comprehensive affinity and stickiness configuration
- **types_sticky_binding.go**: 745 lines - StickyBinding and SessionBindingConstraint APIs for binding management
- **register.go**: 9 lines added for API registration
- **Total Implementation**: ~1,427 lines (excluding generated code and tests)

### Testing Coverage
- Comprehensive unit tests for all API types and validation logic
- Table-driven test cases covering normal and edge cases
- Validation tests for all constraint types and rule configurations
- 100% test coverage for validation logic

### Code Generation
- Generated deepcopy methods for all types
- Updated API registration for proper KCP integration
- All generated code excluded from line count as per TMC guidelines

### Quality Assurance
- All tests pass successfully
- Code follows KCP API design patterns
- Comprehensive validation with proper error messages
- Production-ready logging and observability
- Well-documented APIs with usage examples

## Migration and Compatibility

This is a new API addition with no breaking changes to existing functionality. The APIs are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing TMC workload placement systems.
