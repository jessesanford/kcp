## Summary

This PR completes the cross-workspace placement feature implementation by providing comprehensive integration tests, user documentation, and example configurations. It validates the entire placement system working end-to-end across multiple KCP workspaces.

Key components added:
- **End-to-end cross-workspace placement tests** - Complete workflow validation from policy creation to workload placement
- **Canary deployment integration tests** - Progressive deployment, traffic splitting, and automatic rollback validation
- **Policy evaluation integration tests** - CEL expression evaluation, policy precedence, and constraint enforcement
- **User documentation** - Comprehensive guide for cross-workspace placement usage
- **Example configurations** - Real-world placement policies and canary deployment configurations

## Related Issue(s)

Part of TMC Phase 4 Cross-Workspace Placement implementation. This PR integrates and validates all placement components implemented in previous branches (13-22).

## Test Coverage

This PR adds comprehensive test coverage for:

### Cross-Workspace Placement Tests (`test/e2e/placement/crossworkspace_test.go`)
- âœ… Full placement workflow validation
- âœ… Workspace discovery and selection 
- âœ… Cross-workspace placement execution
- âœ… Placement conflict resolution
- âœ… Policy updates and workload migration
- âœ… Cross-workspace permission enforcement

### Canary Deployment Tests (`test/e2e/placement/canary_test.go`)
- âœ… Progressive traffic splitting (10% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)
- âœ… Canary metrics collection and analysis
- âœ… Automatic rollback on failure detection
- âœ… Manual rollback operations
- âœ… Service dependency handling in canary deployments

### Policy Evaluation Tests (`test/e2e/placement/policy_test.go`) 
- âœ… CEL expression evaluation with various patterns
- âœ… Policy precedence and inheritance resolution
- âœ… Constraint enforcement (required labels, resource quotas)
- âœ… Dynamic policy updates and real-time application
- âœ… Policy conflict detection and resolution

### Documentation & Examples
- âœ… Complete user guide for cross-workspace placement (`docs/placement/cross-workspace.md`)
- âœ… Real-world placement policy examples (`examples/placement/policies.yaml`)
- âœ… Canary deployment configurations
- âœ… Troubleshooting and best practices

## Integration Points Validated

This PR validates integration between all TMC Phase 4 components:

- **Placement Controller** â†” **Policy Engine**: Validates policy evaluation drives placement decisions
- **Workspace Discovery** â†” **Placement Controller**: Ensures dynamic workspace discovery works with placement
- **Canary Controller** â†” **Rollback Engine**: Validates automatic rollback triggers and execution
- **CEL Evaluator** â†” **Policy Engine**: Tests CEL expression evaluation in placement policies
- **Cross-Workspace Controller** â†” **All Components**: Validates cross-workspace coordination

## Architecture Validation

The integration tests validate the complete TMC architecture:

1. **Policy Definition** â†’ CEL evaluation â†’ **Placement Decision**
2. **Workspace Discovery** â†’ Target selection â†’ **Cross-workspace deployment** 
3. **Canary Strategy** â†’ Traffic splitting â†’ **Metrics collection** â†’ **Rollback decision**
4. **Conflict Detection** â†’ **Resolution strategy** â†’ **Policy enforcement**

## Performance Considerations

Tests include performance validation for:
- Policy evaluation latency with complex CEL expressions
- Cross-workspace placement coordination overhead
- Canary traffic splitting performance impact
- Rollback operation speed and reliability

## Security Validation

Integration tests verify:
- Cross-workspace RBAC boundary enforcement
- Policy constraint security validation
- Workspace isolation during placement operations
- Audit logging of all placement decisions

## Release Notes

```
Add comprehensive integration tests and documentation for cross-workspace placement

This release completes the TMC Phase 4 cross-workspace placement feature with:
- End-to-end integration test suites validating complete placement workflows
- Canary deployment testing with progressive traffic splitting and automatic rollback
- Policy evaluation testing with CEL expressions and constraint enforcement  
- Complete user documentation and real-world example configurations
- Validation of all cross-workspace placement components working together

The feature enables intelligent workload placement across KCP workspaces with policy-driven
decisions, progressive canary deployments, and automatic rollback capabilities.
