## Summary

This PR introduces the foundation for the TMC (Transparent Multi-Cluster) placement engine system, implementing the core `PlacementEngine` interface with a round-robin placement algorithm.

**Key Components:**
- `PlacementEngine` interface defining cluster selection contract  
- `RoundRobinEngine` implementation with stateful round-robin distribution
- Integration with TMC API types for workload placement decisions
- Comprehensive cluster filtering based on selectors (labels, locations, names)

## What Type of PR Is This?

/kind feature

## Implementation Details

**PlacementEngine Interface:**
- Defines `SelectClusters` method for placement decisions
- Returns scored placement decisions with rationale  
- Supports context-based cancellation and timeouts

**RoundRobinEngine Features:**
- Thread-safe placement state management
- Maintains placement history per cluster selector
- Even distribution across eligible clusters
- Configurable cluster count selection

**Cluster Filtering:**
- Label selector support using Kubernetes label matching
- Location-based filtering for geographic placement
- Explicit cluster name selection
- Composable filtering with AND logic

## Test Plan

- [ ] Unit tests for PlacementEngine interface (follow-up PR)
- [ ] RoundRobinEngine algorithm validation (follow-up PR)
- [ ] Cluster filtering logic verification (follow-up PR) 
- [ ] Concurrent access safety tests (follow-up PR)

## Dependencies

- Based on main branch
- Requires TMC API types (included via generated code)
- Part of placement engine foundation series

## Breaking Changes

None - this is new functionality.

## Notes

- **Line Count**: 1009 lines (44% over target) - includes significant generated SDK code
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (tests delivered in separate PR for size management)
- This PR establishes the placement engine foundation for TMC workload distribution
