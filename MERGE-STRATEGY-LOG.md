## Conflict Resolution Log
### General Strategy
- Import conflicts: Keep all unique imports, deduplicate
- Function conflicts: Preserve both if different functionality
- Type conflicts: Merge fields, keep all validations
- Test conflicts: Keep all test cases
- Controller conflicts: Ensure all controllers register properly

### Specific Branch Conflicts
(Will be populated as merges proceed)

## Issues & Blockers
- None currently identified

## Validation Results
### After Phase 1:
- make generate: (pending)
- make test: (pending)
- make build: (pending)

## Progress Notes
- Starting with systematic merge of all TMC branches
- Target: Complete all 90+ branches without stopping
- Strategy: No-fast-forward merges to preserve history
- Validation: Run tests after each phase
