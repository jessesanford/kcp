# Implementation Instructions: Canary Deployment Strategy (Branch 20)

## Overview
This branch implements the canary deployment strategy with traffic management, progressive rollout, and automated analysis. It provides state machine-based canary progression with metrics-driven promotion decisions.

## Dependencies
- **Base**: feature/tmc-phase4-14b-deployment-interfaces
- **Uses**: Branches 14a (types), 14b (interfaces)
- **Required for**: Branch 22 (rollback)

## Files to Create

### 1. `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/controller.go` (120 lines)
Canary deployment controller implementation.

### 2. `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/state_machine.go` (100 lines)
State machine for canary progression.

### 3. `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/analysis.go` (90 lines)
Metrics analysis for canary validation.

### 4. `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/traffic.go` (80 lines)
Traffic shifting management.

### 5. `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/metrics.go` (60 lines)
Metrics collection and evaluation.

### 6. `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/canary_test.go` (130 lines)
Comprehensive canary strategy tests.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setup Dependencies
Ensure deployment interfaces are available.

### Step 2: Create Package Structure
```bash
mkdir -p pkg/deployment/strategies/canary
```

### Step 3: Implement Canary Components
1. Start with state_machine.go - state transitions
2. Add controller.go - main canary controller
3. Create analysis.go - metric analysis
4. Add traffic.go - traffic management
5. Create metrics.go - metric collection
6. Add comprehensive tests

### Step 4: State Machine Testing
Thoroughly test all state transitions.

## KCP Patterns to Follow

1. **State Machine**: Clear state transitions
2. **Progressive Rollout**: Gradual traffic shifting
3. **Metric Analysis**: Data-driven decisions
4. **Rollback Ready**: Quick rollback capability
5. **Event Tracking**: Audit trail of decisions

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] State machine transition tests
- [ ] Canary progression tests
- [ ] Metric analysis tests
