# Implementation Instructions: Rollback & Recovery Engine (Branch 22)

## Overview
This branch implements rollback detection and recovery mechanisms for failed deployments. It provides automated rollback triggers, snapshot management, and recovery procedures to ensure system stability during deployment failures.

## Dependencies
- **Base**: feature/tmc-phase4-20-canary-strategy
- **Uses**: Branches 14a-d, 20, 21
- **Required for**: Branch 23 (integration)

## Files to Create

### 1. `pkg/deployment/rollback/detector.go` (90 lines)
Failure detection and rollback triggers.

### 2. `pkg/deployment/rollback/controller.go` (110 lines)
Rollback orchestration controller.

### 3. `pkg/deployment/rollback/snapshot.go` (80 lines)
State snapshot management.

### 4. `pkg/deployment/rollback/recovery.go` (100 lines)
Recovery procedures and state restoration.

### 5. `pkg/deployment/rollback/history.go` (70 lines)
Rollback history tracking.

### 6. `pkg/deployment/rollback/rollback_test.go` (130 lines)
Comprehensive rollback tests.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setup Dependencies
Ensure canary and dependency branches are available.

### Step 2: Create Package Structure
```bash
mkdir -p pkg/deployment/rollback
```

### Step 3: Implement Rollback Components
1. Start with detector.go - failure detection
2. Add snapshot.go - state preservation
3. Create controller.go - rollback orchestration
4. Add recovery.go - state restoration
5. Create history.go - audit trail
6. Add comprehensive tests

### Step 4: Recovery Testing
Test various failure and recovery scenarios.

## KCP Patterns to Follow

1. **Failure Detection**: Quick failure identification
2. **State Preservation**: Reliable snapshots
3. **Atomic Rollback**: All-or-nothing rollback
4. **Recovery Procedures**: Clear recovery steps
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete rollback history

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Failure detection tests
- [ ] Snapshot/restore tests
- [ ] Rollback execution tests
- [ ] Recovery procedure tests
- [ ] History tracking tests
