# Split Plan for Canary Strategy Branch

## Current State
- Total lines: 1305 (implementation) + 256 (tests) = 1561 total
- Files: 6 Go files (5 implementation, 1 test)
- Exceeds limit by: 505 lines (implementation only)

## File Distribution
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/analysis.go`: 347 lines
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/controller.go`: 347 lines
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/metrics.go`: 273 lines
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/state_machine.go`: 136 lines
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/traffic.go`: 202 lines
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/canary_test.go`: 256 lines

## Split Strategy

### Branch 20a: Canary State Machine and Traffic Management (338 lines)
**Files:**
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/state_machine.go`: 136 lines
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/traffic.go`: 202 lines

**Dependencies:** None (builds on existing deployment types)

**Purpose:**
- Define canary deployment state transitions
- Implement traffic splitting logic
- Establish the core state management for canary deployments

### Branch 20b: Canary Metrics and Analysis (620 lines)
**Files:**
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/metrics.go`: 273 lines
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/analysis.go`: 347 lines

**Dependencies:** Branch 20a (state machine)

**Purpose:**
- Implement metrics collection for canary analysis
- Add analysis engine for success/failure determination
- Provide decision-making logic based on metrics

### Branch 20c: Canary Controller and Tests (603 lines)
**Files:**
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/controller.go`: 347 lines
- `pkg/deployment/strategies/canary/canary_test.go`: 256 lines

**Dependencies:** Branch 20a, Branch 20b

**Purpose:**
- Implement the main canary controller
- Integrate all components into a working controller
- Add comprehensive test coverage

## Execution Order
1. **Branch 20a** - Foundation (state machine, traffic management)
2. **Branch 20b** - Analytics (metrics collection, analysis engine)
3. **Branch 20c** - Controller and integration tests

## Success Criteria
- Each sub-branch remains under 700 lines
- Maintains atomic functionality per branch
- Clear dependency chain with sequential merging
- Tests concentrated in final branch for complete coverage
- Each branch provides value independently

## Implementation Notes
- Branch 20a provides the core state management without active control
- Branch 20b adds observability and decision-making capabilities
- Branch 20c ties everything together with the controller implementation
- The controller in 20c will leverage all components from 20a and 20b
- Test coverage focuses on integration testing in the final branch
