# Split Plan for Branch 10 - Rollback Engine

## Current State
- Total lines: 896
- Files:
  - detector.go (262 lines) - Failure detection logic
  - snapshot.go (291 lines) - State snapshot management
  - controller.go (245 lines) - Rollback controller
  - recovery.go (98 lines) - Recovery utilities
- Exceeds limit by: 196 lines (target was 700)

## Split Strategy

### Branch 10a: Rollback Foundation (553 lines)
- Files:
  - detector.go (262 lines) - Failure detection framework
  - snapshot.go (291 lines) - Snapshot creation and management
- Dependencies: None
- Purpose: Establishes core rollback infrastructure with failure detection and state preservation capabilities

### Branch 10b: Rollback Controller & Recovery (343 lines)
- Files:
  - controller.go (245 lines) - Rollback orchestration controller
  - recovery.go (98 lines) - Recovery procedures and utilities
- Dependencies: Branch 10a (requires detector and snapshot)
- Purpose: Implements the controller logic that orchestrates rollbacks and recovery procedures

## Execution Order
1. Branch 10a - Foundation infrastructure (must merge first)
2. Branch 10b - Controller and recovery (depends on 10a)

## Success Criteria
- Each sub-branch is under 700 lines âœ“
- Maintains atomic functionality:
  - 10a provides working detection and snapshot capabilities
  - 10b adds the controller that uses these capabilities
- Clear dependencies established
- Sequential execution ensures proper integration

## Implementation Notes

### Branch 10a Details
The foundation branch establishes:
- **Detector (262 lines)**:
  - Health check mechanisms
  - Failure threshold tracking
  - Alert generation for rollback conditions
  - Integration with metrics and monitoring
- **Snapshot (291 lines)**:
  - State capture mechanisms
  - Snapshot storage and retrieval
  - Version management
  - Snapshot validation and integrity checks

This provides the essential building blocks for rollback functionality - the ability to detect when rollback is needed and capture/restore state.

### Branch 10b Details
The controller branch completes:
- **Controller (245 lines)**:
  - Reconciliation loop for rollback operations
  - Integration with detector for trigger conditions
  - Orchestration of snapshot restore operations
  - Status reporting and event generation
- **Recovery (98 lines)**:
  - Recovery utility functions
  - Rollback validation procedures
  - Cleanup operations post-rollback
  - Helper functions for state restoration

This adds the orchestration layer that uses the foundation components to perform actual rollbacks.

## Risk Mitigation
- Foundation branch (10a) can be tested independently with unit tests
- Controller branch (10b) includes integration points that can be mocked for testing
- Each branch maintains backward compatibility
- Clear interfaces between components allow for isolated testing

## Testing Strategy
- Branch 10a: Unit tests for detector thresholds and snapshot operations
- Branch 10b: Integration tests for full rollback scenarios
- Both branches should include failure injection tests

## Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Option 1**: Split by complete features (detector+recovery vs snapshot+controller)
  - Rejected: Would create uneven splits and break logical coupling
- **Option 2**: Extract interfaces to separate branch
  - Rejected: Too small for separate branch, better included in foundation
- **Selected**: Split by infrastructure vs orchestration layers
  - Provides clean separation of concerns
  - Maintains atomic functionality in each branch
  - Enables incremental deployment
