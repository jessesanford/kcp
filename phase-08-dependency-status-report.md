# Phase 8 Dependency Status Report

## Executive Summary

**Phase 8 Cross-Workspace Runtime** has all required dependencies satisfied and can proceed with available work.

## Dependency Analysis Results

### Phase-Level Dependencies

| Dependency | Required For | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Phase 5** | Placement interfaces | ✅ **100% COMPLETE** | Implementation summary confirms completion |
| **Phase 6** | VW infrastructure (Wave 1) | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Wave plan shows all waves executed |
| **Phase 7** | Syncer (Wave 3 Status Agg) | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Implementation complete per wave plan |

### Wave-Level Dependencies

| Wave | Dependencies | Status | Can Proceed? |
|------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| **Wave 1** | Phase 5 & 6 | ✅ Met | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Wave 2** | Wave 1 | ✅ Met | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Wave 3** | Wave 2 & Phase 7 | ✅ Met | ✅ Can proceed |

## Current Phase 8 Status

### Completed Components (87.5%)
- ✅ Wave 1: Workspace Discovery (8.1.1)
- ✅ Wave 1: API Discovery (8.1.2)
- ✅ Wave 2: Placement Scheduler (8.2.1)
- ✅ Wave 2: CEL Evaluator (8.2.2)
- ✅ Wave 2: Decision Maker (8.2.3)
- ✅ Wave 3: Cross-Workspace Controller (8.3.1)
- ✅ Wave 3: Placement Binding (8.3.2)

### Remaining Work
- ⏳ Wave 3: Status Aggregation (8.3.3) - **NOW UNBLOCKED** (Phase 7 complete)

## Critical Finding

**Status Aggregation (8.3.3) is NO LONGER BLOCKED!** 

Phase 7 (Syncer) has been completed, which means the final component of Phase 8 can now be implemented.

## Actionable Work for Phase 8

### Immediate Actions Available

1. **Implement Status Aggregation (8.3.3)**
   - Dependencies: ✅ Phase 7 syncer complete
   - Target: 550 lines
   - Wave: 3
   - Priority: HIGH - Last component needed

2. **Complete PR Splits** (In Progress)
   - Decision Maker: 2 of 5 splits complete
   - Cross-Workspace Controller: 0 of 3 splits complete
   - CEL Evaluator: Needs splitting (1715 lines discovered)

3. **Create PR Messages** (Complete)
   - All 5 main branches have PR messages

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Implement Status Aggregation
Since Phase 7 is complete, the Status Aggregation component can now be implemented. This will complete Phase 8 at 100%.

### Priority 2: Complete Branch Splits
Continue with the remaining PR splits:
- Decision Maker: Complete PRs 3, 4, 5
- Controller: Start 3-way split
- CEL Evaluator: Plan and execute split

### Priority 3: Update Wave Status
Once Status Aggregation is implemented, mark Wave 3 and Phase 8 as complete using `/update-phase-wave-status`.

## Conclusion

**All dependencies for Phase 8 are satisfied.** The phase can proceed to completion with the implementation of Status Aggregation (8.3.3) and finalization of PR splits for oversized components.
