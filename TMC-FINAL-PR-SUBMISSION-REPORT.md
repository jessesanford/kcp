## Branch Dependencies

All branches are currently based directly on `main`, which enables independent parallel development. However, logical dependencies exist:

### Dependency Chain Analysis

1. **Feature Flags** → All other features
2. **Controller Patterns** → All controller implementations
3. **Workspace Isolation** → All multi-tenant features
4. **Core APIs** → API-dependent features
5. **Cluster Registration** → Cluster management features
6. **Placement Engine** → Workload placement features

## Critical Actions Required

### Immediate (Next 48 Hours)
1. **Split oversized foundation branches** (00a1, 00b1)
2. **Submit feature flags PR** (00c - ready to go)
3. **Split API foundation branch** (05a2a - 5359 lines)
4. **Split cluster controller branch** (05b - 6577 lines)

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Begin Wave 1 submissions after splits complete
2. Prepare Wave 2 branches for review
3. Continue splitting oversized branches
4. Ensure all PR messages are updated

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Submit Waves 1-4 for review
2. Begin integration testing
3. Prepare Waves 5-9 for submission

## PR Message Status

**PR Messages Collected:** 39 files  
**Location:** `/workspaces/kcp-worktrees/tmc-planning/pr-messages/`

### Available PR Messages by Branch:
- ✅ All foundation branches have PR messages
- ✅ All ready-to-submit branches have PR messages
- ❌ Split branches will need updated PR messages

## Quality Metrics Summary

### Line Count Distribution:
- **Under 700 lines (Ready):** 22 branches (43%)
- **700-1000 lines (Minor Split):** 8 branches (16%)
- **1000-2000 lines (Major Split):** 15 branches (29%)
- **Over 2000 lines (Critical Split):** 6 branches (12%)
