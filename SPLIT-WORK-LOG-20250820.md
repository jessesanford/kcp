# Split 1 of 3: Core TMC API Types Implementation

## Overview
- **Split**: 1 of 3
- **Target**: Core TMC API Types (TMCConfig, TMCStatus, ResourceIdentifier, ClusterIdentifier)
- **Working Directory**: /workspaces/efforts/phase1/wave1/effort1-api-types-core-split1
- **Branch**: phase1/wave1/effort1-api-types-core-part1
- **Target Size**: ~400 lines (max 800)
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Started**: 2025-08-20

## Operations Log

### Operation 1: Setup and Planning
- **Time**: 2025-08-20
- **Action**: Created work log and examined original implementation
- **Files**: SPLIT-WORK-LOG-20250820.md (created)
- **Line Count**: 0 lines added (baseline)
- **Status**: Completed

### Operation 2: Core API Implementation
- **Time**: 2025-08-20
- **Action**: Created apis/tmc/v1alpha1/ directory structure and implemented core types
- **Files**: apis/tmc/v1alpha1/types.go, register.go, doc.go (created)
- **Line Count**: 238 lines added (cumulative)
- **Status**: Completed

### Operation 3: Deepcopy Generation
- **Time**: 2025-08-20
- **Action**: Generated deepcopy methods using controller-gen
- **Files**: apis/tmc/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go (generated)
- **Line Count**: 426 lines added (total)
- **Status**: Completed

### Operation 4: Build Testing and Formatting
- **Time**: 2025-08-20
- **Action**: Tested build, formatting, and vetting of API package
- **Files**: All files formatted by go fmt
- **Line Count**: 426 lines (final count)
- **Status**: Completed

## File Structure Implemented
```
apis/tmc/v1alpha1/
├── doc.go              # Package documentation with codegen markers ✓
├── types.go            # Core TMC types (TMCConfig, TMCStatus, ResourceIdentifier, ClusterIdentifier) ✓
├── register.go         # Scheme registration for known types ✓
└── zz_generated.deepcopy.go  # Generated deepcopy methods ✓
```

## Line Count Tracking
- Target: ~400 lines (max 800)
- Current: 426 lines TOTAL ✓ (Within target!)
- Command: git diff --cached --stat

## Notes
- Working with clean cherry-picks from original effort1-api-types-core
- Focusing only on core/base TMC types for split 1
- All advanced types (placement, scheduling, etc.) reserved for splits 2 & 3
